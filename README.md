TinyRGB
=======

##Abstract

TinyRGB is a small learning project of mine. The goal is to replace remote controlled drivers of cheap RGB strips
by a small Bluetooth-Enabled controller and driver. 

##Design Considerations
The board layout has been restricted to 5x5cm so you can get your PCBs produced for instance by Seedstudio for
very little investment. The ATTiny4313 microcontroller has been chosen with the Arduino-Community in mind. While 
this chip is not compatible with your Arduino-IDE per se, it is very closely related to it and should make it 
a little bit more accessible. The Bluetooth module used is one of the most popular ones across the hacker communities
and can be sourced for few dollars from ebay / china. 

##Current Status

The hardware can be considered to be beta at best. Current issues are:

- [ ] 7805 regulator needs to be Rotated by 180Â° to prevent issues with heatsink mounting
- [ ] Better decoupling
- [ ] Consider to
